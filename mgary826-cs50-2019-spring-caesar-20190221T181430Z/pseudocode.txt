Make sure that argc only has 2 inputs, the key and argv[1] which is the plaintext. 
Convert the string into an int using ascii
Declare Plaintext       
Run through each of the char in the array and adds the key to each of the elements
If Lowercase
    Print statement that takes the text[i] and subtracts it by 'a' which is 97, add the key.  But we can't just leave it like that because then it once text[i] == 'z'  it will continue with the ascii until it gets to 123, the { key.  Instead we want to loop it back to 'a' so we have to %26 and add 'a' again to get it to loop.     
               
 If Uppercase
     Print statement takes the text[i] and subtracts it by 'A' which is 65, adds the key.  But we can't just leave it like that because then it once text[i] == 'Z'  it will continue with the ascii until it gets to 91, the [ key.  Instead we want to loop it back to 'A' so we have to %26 and add 'A' again to get it to loop. 
Print text such as spaces that don't interfer and loop
Print new line
